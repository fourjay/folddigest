# FoldDigest

This is a fairly useful outline of a file, based on fold markers.

An example scenario, fold python based on indent. ``:FoldDigest`` will
pull up a vertical buffer with list of functions with live links between
the two.


This is a fork of an old script at

    This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3240

I've added:

filetype + syntax for the folddigest buffer

# Original Readme

This plugin creates a new buffer with an outline view of all folds in the current buffer.
It is based on vimscript #732.
Usage:
	:FoldDigest

   Transform all folds in the current buffer into digest tree form, and
   show it in another buffer.  The buffer is called ==FOLDDIGEST==.  It shows
   not only all fold start positions, but also a tree depended on original
   folds hierarchy.

   In a FOLDDIGEST, you can move around the cursor, and when type <CR> jump
   to fold at under it.  If you enter FOLDDIGEST window from other windows,
   when depended buffer is availabeled, it will be synchronized
   automatically.  If you want to force synchronize, type "r" in a
   FOLDDIGEST buffer.
   It is also possible to jump to the folsd under the cursor with a double
   click.
   The FOLDDIGEST window is updated when entering in a new buffer.

   :FoldDigestToggle

   Toggles FOLDDIGEST window

   :FoldDigestClose

   close FOLDDIGEST window

   You can also map your own keys to these commands

Options:

    'folddigest_options'
                string (default "")
        Set string flag which you need.  If you want to use more than two,
        join by comma.

          flexnumwidth  Narrow line number width as possible.
          nofoldclose   don't close folds after ":call FoldDigest()".
          vertical      Use :vsplit for FOLDDIGEST. (default :split)

    'folddigest_size'
                number (default 0)
        FOLDDIGEST window size.  When 'folddigest_options' has "vertical"
        flag, this value is interpretted as window height, and doesn't then
        as window width.  If zero was specified height/width become half of
        current window.

    ex:
        :let folddigest_options = "vertical,flexnumwidth"
        :let folddigest_size = 30
