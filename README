This plugin creates a new buffer with an outline view of all folds in the current buffer.
It is based on vimscript #732.
Usage:
	:FoldDigest

   Transform all folds in the current buffer into digest tree form, and
   show it in another buffer.  The buffer is called ==FOLDDIGEST==.  It shows
   not only all fold start positions, but also a tree depended on original
   folds hierarchy.

   In a FOLDDIGEST, you can move around the cursor, and when type <CR> jump
   to fold at under it.  If you enter FOLDDIGEST window from other windows,
   when depended buffer is availabeled, it will be synchronized
   automatically.  If you want to force synchronize, type "r" in a
   FOLDDIGEST buffer.
   It is also possible to jump to the folsd under the cursor with a double
   click.
   The FOLDDIGEST window is updated when entering in a new buffer.

   :FoldDigestToggle

   Toggles FOLDDIGEST window

   :FoldDigestClose
